# Lingo-GameplusLearning

I created a multiple activity App called “Lingo”, it was very much on the lines of the
famous Language learning App “Duolingo”. It made the learning engaging and the content was such that
if you never knew the language you could still guess what the word could be with the help of visual
clues, it also had lives as there are in games, such that you had certain lives and if you ran out of those,
then you would have to start that stage over again and complete this time without losing all the lives
you had!
